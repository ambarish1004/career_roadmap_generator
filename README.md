## Career Roadmap Generator

# About

This project is about tracking your career. The platform allows users to explore roadmaps created by experienced professionals, helping them decide the best direction for their growth. Once they start their journey, they can track their progress—how much they’ve learned, what’s left to cover, and the opportunities available at their current skill level, including job roles, salaries, and required qualifications.

Additionally, users can create and share their own career roadmaps based on their experiences, making it a community-driven platform. I also plan to integrate AI-based guidance, so students can get personalized recommendations or generate roadmaps based on their interests and learning patterns. Another key feature will be community groups, where top users can create forums for discussions, technical news, and knowledge sharing. This way, students can stay updated with industry trends and get guidance from professionals.
